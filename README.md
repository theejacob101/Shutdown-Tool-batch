This tool can help shutdown a PC.

How to use

1. **Type your type of shutdown**

 You can select your type of shutdown by using the shutdown flags. For example you can do `/s /c "This is a shutdown"` to shutdown the PC with the comment displayed. Also for quick access you can simply type "." to default to the /s flag. Not all flags are listed so if you want to see other flags you can run the `shutdown /?` to see all flags. (You do not need to do a delay or `/t` modifier as it will do this automatically in step 2.)

2. **Set delay**

 For this step you can set a delay for how long you want to delay the shutdown for. This will default to 30 secs. **NOTE**: You need to write this delay in seconds.

3. **Press any key to start the process.**

4. **Abort the shutdown**

   The script will now ask if you want to abort the shutdown. Use the Y and N key to answer.
